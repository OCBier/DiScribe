Tom	0:0:0	OK, well. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for being here on time. We've got a lot to do
today to so let's get started now everyone scare apart from Jaun in facilities. But we have apologies from him as everyone
got a copy of the agenda.


Tom	0:3:19	Good OK can I draw your attention to item 4? Where it says presentation of online survey results presentation
is going to be given by Miss Patricia Reyes, who is a representative of the research company. We contracted to carry out
the work in this race will arrive at 11:30. So I plan to break at about 11:15 to give her time to set up it may also mean
that we need to interrupt.


Tom	0:8:49	The first few are gender items, but we'll come back to those an Darcy. I'd like to leave a little bit
of time under any other business to just.


Tom	0:10:2	Maya I'm aware that flexible working hours has a particular impact on some of your team do you have
any thoughts on that?


Maya	0:12:12	Well, from my point of view? What Paul is proposing sounds fine. I am a bit concerned about working
with the system of core hours and then flexible hours. But I think we all need time to read through pause proposal in more
detail before discussing it any further.


Tom	0:14:29	OK, that sounds reasonable and what do other people think and you agree with my are that we need to
look through the proposal in more detail 1st.


Tom	0:16:39	Yes, OK well, I'm sure we can return to it at next month's meeting.

Tom	0:17:46	Good we all OK to move onto the next point.

Tom	0:18:51	Right so the up and coming board meeting.

Tom	0:19:57	Now we don't need to spend too much time on this, but there are one or 2 issues, which we need to
be aware of Lydia. Can you warn me if we go beyond 10 minutes on this one?
