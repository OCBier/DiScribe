Brian Kernighan	0:0:0	Newer machines instead of having everything in the machine be a single size of in effect integer. Let's
say 16 bits or something like that. They had different sizes that were in the machine would efficiently and naturally manipulate
8 bit 16 bit maybe 32 bit.


Brian Kernighan	0:2:16	And the language be didn't reflect that and so Dennis Ritchie undertook to design what amounted to
a version of be that was richer and head mechanisms in the language to say this is an 8 bit quantity. This is a 16 bit quantity.
Basically, they care. An int types that you see in the early versions of C and so he wrote a compiler for that and then with
the compiler in hand. They started to rewrite the operating system itself in C and this took a while, but

Not recognized	0:9:56	Or is it trying to do what we asked and there was a problem.

Janelle Shane	0:10:1	So, in movies when something goes wrong with AI. It's usually because the AI has decided that doesn't
want to obey the humans anymore. And it's got his own goals. Thank you very much so in real life, though the AI that we actually
have is not nearly smart enough for that. It has the approximate computing power of an earthworm or maybe at most single
honeybee.


Nick Smith	0:14:25	And actually probably maybe less like we're constantly learning new things about brains that make it clear
how much are a eyes don't measure up to real brains, so today's AI can do some a task like identify pedestrian and first
thing that we're going to start doing is talk a little bit about what store is and why it is important for the pilots to
be able to control and approaching stalled condition so there are thousands. Maybe not thousands, but there are several good

Nick Smith	0:20:0	But you need to understand is that an aircraft wing works when the air is flowing freely around it right
so the air flows underwing and on Top of the wing and if the aircraft starts taking out a higher angle of attack which means
that it's increasing the angle towards the ongoing wind well, then it's going to be harder and harder for the air to stay
following the oversight of wing and at some point, which is called the critical angle of attack the air will not now. The
second reason that coding is difficult.


Patrick Shyu	0:25:32	I believe is because they requires an inordinate amount of time sitting in front of the computer and
just staring at that screen.


Patrick Shyu	0:26:39	And this is going to be probably far more time than you may be used to write for most other disciplines.
You don't need to be sitting down for a large amount of time focused on something like say 2 to 3 hours. You can learn on
the go right, you could go to a restaurant while you're eating. Maybe you could read up on the little bit of biology right
learn a little bit of chemistry while you're in the car spent 20 minutes at the beach reading a chapter of your history book.
That's OK. That's fine, then that type of learning can be done in segments, but for computer programming. You really need
to be sedated.


Patrick Shyu	0:31:9	A single place at your desk at the computer for a long period of time. Many people are just not used
to being with.
