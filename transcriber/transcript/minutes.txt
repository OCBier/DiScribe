USER_2068116224	0:0:0	OK, well. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for being here on time. We've got a lot to do
today to so let's get started now everyone scare apart from Jaun in facilities. But we have apologies from him as everyone
got a copy of the agenda.


USER_1762579791	0:41:8	Good OK can I draw your attention to item 4? Where it says presentation of online survey results presentation
is going to be given by Miss Patricia Reyes, who is a representative of the research company. We contracted to carry out
the work in this race will arrive at 11:30. So I plan to break at about 11:15 to give her time to set up it may also mean
that we need to interrupt.


USER_1136216832	0:21:8	The first few are gender items, but we'll come back to those an Darcy. I'd like to leave a little
bit of time under any other business.


USER_1306134730	0:25:32	No.

USER_15422070	0:36:36	Maya I'm aware that flexible working hours has a particular impact on some of your team do you have
any thoughts on that?


USER_1660921865	0:24:24	Well, from my point of view? What Paul is proposing sounds fine. I am a bit concerned about working
with the system of core hours and then flexible hours. But I think we all need time to read through pause proposal in more
detail before discussing it any further.


USER_124157577	0:54:28	OK, that sounds reasonable and what do other people think and you agree with my are that we need to
look through the proposal in more detail 1st.


USER_591330000	0:53:20	Yes, OK well, I'm sure we can return to it at next month's meeting.
